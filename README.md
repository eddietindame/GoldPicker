# GoldPicker
Java applet where players must choose the golden rectangle out of three randomly generated rectangles (one has golden ratio).

Challengers must play against the clock in order to achieve a high score. Difficulty level will determine how much time the player has to choose golden! Varying comments help tell the player how they are doing.

Different game modes offer slightly different takes on the main game. One has you focusing on the points while the other has you clicking to stay alive!

Combo and score count keep the player coming back to beat their old records. A higher combo means more points for a correct answer.

This is an unsigned applet so it can not be embedded into a browser - run it in an IDE such as Netbeans.
